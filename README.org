* Larrylogoh's dots[WIP]
Use at your own risk.
** Requirements
- bash
- dunst
- GNU emacs
- git
- mpv
- sxhkd
- xinit
- [[https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl][youtube-dl]]
** How to use
Clone it and put the files where they belong.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/Larrylogoh/dots
#+END_SRC
Or use pulldots.sh in .local/scripts.
That sets up a git bare repository as well, which is how I prefer to handle my dotfiles.
